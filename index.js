/* Psuedo Code for Initial Commit

  Take user input and store as a variable
  Take variable, should be a string, and split() it into an array of strings
  Loop through the array of strings and add them to an object (need to create an object)
  
  rules for the object
  need to keep count of each flavor

  let froyoOrder = {
    flavorname : count#,
    flavorname2 : count#,
    flavorname3 : count#,
  }

  need to write a rule for the loop that if something exists in the order already, add to the count
  otherwise add flavorName and set count to 1 (related to updating values in keyvalues pairs)

  will be using either
  Object.keys(userInputtedFroyoOrder)
  For (let froyoFlavor in userInputtedFroyoOrder)

  Return Object with froyo flavor numbers
